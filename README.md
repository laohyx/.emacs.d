# .emacs.d

Hello,
This is my emacs.d repository. It was motivated by my friends saying that `The masters are using emacs.`

Well, I am indeed using emacs, but just to edit conf files via SSH. But this time, I want to be a `master`.


In the future, I will referen precell's configurations, to build a portable config repo.
